# MacOS Running on the Lenovo M93P Tower

## Supports MacOS 10.15.5 --> 11.1

This repo is my active opencore EFI of my Lenovo M93P Tower Hack

This was a fairly easy hack. Follow the main desktop guide here please: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/

SMBIOS is set to iMac Pro for compatability reasons (I got tired of updating my SMBIOS with every new OS Apple launched. iMacPro1,1 will support many more generations to come. I have yet to USB map as for every hack may be different unless you have this exact build. I will update soon.
