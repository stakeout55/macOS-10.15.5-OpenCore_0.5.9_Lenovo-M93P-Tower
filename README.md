# macOS-10.15.5-OpenCore_0.5.9_Lenovo-M93P-Tower
This repo is my active opencore EFI of my Lenovo M93P Tower Hack

This was a fairly easy hack. Follow the main desktop guide here please: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/

To get iServices working: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/post-install/iservices.html
Note: the serilas in the posted EFI are different from mine. Read the iServices guide if having issues signing into icloud and messages app!
